### Predicting NBA MVP Votes Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict NBA MVP vote shares based on player performance statistics. The notebook walks through the process of data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training to forecast MVP outcomes. Below is an overview of the methods used and why they are well-suited for this task.

1. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
The first step in the notebook is data cleaning, which ensures that the model works with high-quality input data. Missing values in key columns like 3P%, FT%, and FG% were handled by filling them with zeros, as these missing values typically correspond to no attempts made (e.g., no three-pointers taken).

Feature engineering followed, which included:

Converting categorical data (e.g., player positions) into numeric dummy variables using one-hot encoding. This allows the model to understand player positions as distinct categories.
Removing irrelevant columns such as player names and team details, which do not contribute to the prediction task.
Eliminating redundant features like 2P%, 3P%, and FG%, which are derived from other statistics. This prevents multicollinearity, ensuring the model does not confuse the relationships between variables.

2. Model Choice: Ridge Regression
For the prediction task, Ridge regression was selected. This regularized version of linear regression was chosen for several reasons:

It effectively handles multicollinearity by penalizing large coefficients, which is crucial in datasets where many features are correlated (such as shooting percentages and attempts).
Regularization helps prevent overfitting by introducing a penalty term, making the model more generalizable to new data.
Ridge regression is ideal for continuous prediction tasks, like forecasting MVP vote shares, which are numerical in nature.

3. Model Evaluation
To evaluate the model’s performance, Mean Squared Error (MSE) was used. This standard metric for regression tasks measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, helping assess the accuracy of the model. A lower MSE indicates better performance.

The model’s accuracy was calculated as (1 - MSE) * 100, providing a percentage that reflects how closely the predicted MVP vote shares match the actual values.

4. MVP Prediction
The trained model was then tested on the 2001 dataset to predict the MVP. The player with the highest predicted vote share was identified as the predicted MVP. This shows the practical application of machine learning to predict real-world outcomes in sports.

Key Takeaways
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering are essential for preparing the dataset and ensuring the model works with the most relevant features.
- Ridge Regression is an ideal method for this task, as it addresses multicollinearity and overfitting, ensuring that the model remains robust and generalizable.
- Model Evaluation using MSE provides a clear measure of accuracy, helping gauge the model's effectiveness.
- The MVP Prediction showcases how machine learning can be applied to predict sports outcomes, offering valuable insights into how player performance metrics influence MVP voting.
- Overall, the notebook provides a thorough demonstration of how machine learning techniques can be used in sports analytics to make data-driven predictions.
